  In 2007, as my illness was really kicking into overdrive, I ended up finding a copy of the Halo Graphic Novel,
  which
  led me to Tsutomu Nihei, a manga artist best known for a story called BLAME! </p>

  <p>Well, I hate bloated stories with memes and shit in them. My script for my upcoming game about chestnut trees and
  dead flight navigators and soda pop and the morality of feeding bodies to pigs, called Adios, is just 4,600 words
  long, give or take. My script for my disorientating, ‘everything is just slightly off’ horror game was probably
  about the same. I like my shit lean because I come from a film school background and when you give me a movie, I
  have one minute per page and I’ve got 90–120 pages to tell a complete story. That’s not a lot of time! A tv show
  is
  worse; you’ve got maaaaybe 50 minutes at most.</p>

  <p>I remember clutching it tightly, scanning the pages, reading through a story about my favorite character,
  Sergeant
  Johnson, fighting his way through the Flood, my favorite enemies in Halo, escaping the ring on his own. It was
  incredible; the way Nihei depicted the pellets coming out of the shotgun (depicted above) as the flood combat form
  fired it… it was stunning and dynamic.</p>

  <h5>Notas</h5>
  <p><span>1</span> You cannot assume that you can take an arbitrary system and break it into microservices. Most
  systems acquire too
  many dependencies between their modules, and thus can't be sensibly broken apart. I've heard of plenty of cases
  where an attempt to decompose a monolith has quickly ended up in a mess. I've also heard of a few cases where a
  gradual route to microservices has been successful - but these cases required a relatively good modular design to
  start with.
  </p>
  <p>
  <span>2</span> I suppose that strictly yo u should call this a "duolith", but I think the approach follows the
  essence of
  monolith-first strategy: start with coarse-granularity to gain knowledge and split later
